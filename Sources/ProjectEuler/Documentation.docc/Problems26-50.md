Problem descriptions of problems 26 to 50

##  Problem 26

Reciprocal cycles

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

    1/2        =     0.5
    1/3        =     0.(3)
    1/4        =     0.25
    1/5        =     0.2
    1/6        =     0.1(6)
    1/7        =     0.(142857)
    1/8        =     0.125
    1/9        =     0.(1)
    1/10       =     0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

##  Problem 27

Quadratic primes

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

$$n^2 + n + 41$$

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $$0 \le n \le 39$$. However, when $$n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $$n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$$ is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula $$n^2 - 79n + 1601$$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $$0 \le n \le 79$$. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

$$n^2 + an + b$$, where $$|a| < 1000$$ and $$|b| \le 1000$$

where $$|n|$$ is the modulus/absolute value of $$n$$

e.g. $$|11| = 11$$ and $$|-4| = 4$$

Find the product of the coefficients, $$a$$ and $$b$$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $$n$$, starting with $$n = 0$$.

##  Problem 28

Number spiral diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

    21 22 23 24 25
    20  7  8  9 10
    19  6  1  2 11
    18  5  4  3 12
    17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?

##  Problem 29

Distinct powers

Consider all integer combinations of ab for $$2 ≤ a ≤ 5$$ and $$2 ≤ b ≤ 5$$:

$$2^2=4$$, $$2^3=8$$, $$2^4=16$$, $$2^5=32$$

$$3^2=9$$, $$3^3=27$$, $$3^4=81$$, $$3^5=243$$

$$4^2=16$$, $$4^3=64$$, $$4^4=256$$, $$4^5=1024$$

$$5^2=25$$, $$5^3=125$$, $$5^4=625$$, $$5^5=3125$$

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

    4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by $$a^b$$ for $$2 ≤ a ≤ 100$$ and $$2 ≤ b ≤ 100$$?

##  Problem 30

Digit fifth powers

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

$$1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4$$  
$$8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4$$  
$$9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4$$  
As $$1 = 1^4$$ is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

##  Problem 31

Coin sums

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

##  Problem 32

Pandigital products

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 × 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

> Tip: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

## Problem 33

Digit cancelling fractions

The fraction $$^{49}/_{98}$$ is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that $$^{49}/_{98}$$ = $$^4/_8$$, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, $$^{30}/_{50}$$ = $$^3/_5$$, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

## Problem 34

Digit factorials

145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

> Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

## Problem 35

Circular primes

The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below one million?

## Problem 36

Double-base palindromes

The decimal number, $$585 = 1001001001_2$$ (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

> Note: Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.

## Problem 37

Truncatable primes

The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

> Note: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

## Problem 38

Pandigital multiples

Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

    192 × 1 = 192
    192 × 2 = 384
    192 × 3 = 576
    
By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?

## Problem 39

Integer right triangles

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p ≤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

## Problem 40

Champernowne's constant

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

0.12345678910<span style="color:red">1</span>112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the $$12^{th}$$ digit of the fractional part is $$1$$.

If $$d_n$$ represents the $$n^{th}$$ digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

$$d_1 × d_{10} × d_{100} × d_{1000} × d_{10000} × d_{100000} × d_{1000000}$$

## Problem 41

Pandigital prime

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

## Problem 42

Coded triangle numbers

The $$n^{th}$$ term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, $$tn = \frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$$; so the first ten triangle numbers are:

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...$$

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for `SKY` is $$19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_{10}$$. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

## Problem 43

Sub-string divisibility

The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

Let $$d_1$$ be the $$1^st$$ digit, $$d_2$$ be the $$2^nd$$ digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:

$$d_2d_3d_4=406$$ is divisible by 2  
$$d_3d_4d_5=063$$ is divisible by 3  
$$d_4d_5d_6=635$$ is divisible by 5  
$$d_5d_6d_7=357$$ is divisible by 7  
$$d_6d_7d_8=572$$ is divisible by 11  
$$d_7d_8d_9=728$$ is divisible by 13  
$$d_8d_9d_{10}=289$$ is divisible by 17  

Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.

## Problem 44

Pentagon numbers

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, $$P_n=n(3n−1)/2$$. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that $$P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8$$. However, their difference, $$70 − 22 = 48$$, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, $$P_j$$ and $$P_k$$, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and $$D = |P_k − P_j|$$ is minimised; what is the value of $$D$$?

## Problem 45

Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

| Series     | Equation          | First entries         |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Triangle   | $$T_n=n(n+1)/2$$  | 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...  |
| Pentagonal | $$P_n=n(3n−1)/2$$ | 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... |
| Hexagonal  | $$H_n=n(2n−1)$$   | 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... |

It can be verified that $$T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
